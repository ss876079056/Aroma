        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always listen to music while painting, sometimes loud rock that makes me feel happy
          and energetic and
          sometimes quiet classical that makes me feel relaxed. This has inspired me to explore music as a second way,
          beyond my visual art, to express myself powerfully to an audience by creating art that can help people engage
          positively with each other. I have wanted to create an instrument that is visually welcoming and encourages
          creativity for a long time.</br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I watch a musician playing the guitar, I often find that the curve of the guitar
          fits his body well, which
          creates a positive relationship between the musician and the instrument, making the performance sound more
          joyful. I enjoy looking at the curves of guitars, the connections between each component part, and the
          contrast
          of different materials, such as wood and metal. Therefore, in one of my portfolio pieces, I depicted five
          detailed snapshots of different parts of a guitar. While I was drawing them, the comfortable curves of the
          guitar connected together and went deep into my mind.</br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to make an instrument of my own, so I thought about the social context
          surrounding instruments,
          performance, and music. In modern society, individualism is praised. For example, parents encourage their
          children to practice music for many hours by themselves, which deprives them of time spent with their peers. I
          wanted to reverse these isolating trends and challenge individualism’s social dominance.</br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drew various comfortable curves in my sketchbook, connected them together to form
          different shapes, and
          refined them into a welcoming ergonomic instrument which allows five people to sit in a circle to play while
          facing each other. With this cooperative instrument, everyone can make an original and unique sound, and
          together they can create multi-layered music while practicing teamwork and working together harmoniously as a
          community.</br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to being cooperative, I wanted my instrument to provide a new way for
          people
          to create innovative
          music. There are no standards and expectations for my never-before-seen instrument, so any pleasing sound
          produced will be encouraging. People won’t be afraid of being criticized when they play, so amateur players
          will
          feel confident to bring their creativity and untaught freshness to the music. Everyone is a novice at playing
          this instrument, so learning to play together will be a group experimental process. I'm looking forward to
          producing music that can make people more sensitive to sounds and each other to bring more human wisdom into
          the
          world.</br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have created a playable prototype, I am happy with the result. When my
          friends and I played it for
          the first time, we faced each other, playing a harmonious and interesting melody, and enjoying a happy
          atmosphere. We all had different interpretations of the sounds, and we worked together to create a song that
          combined our individual contributions.

        <img src="./images/work/detail/image-4.jpg" class="work_img" style="width: 100%;"></img>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This summer vacation, I enjoyed strolling around my local Hutong, one of the
          neighborhoods of narrow alleyways
          particular to Beijing. I felt as if the city was talking to me through the graffiti and stickers from
          underground organizations pasted on the walls of the Hutong as well as the government banners promoting
          socialist core values. I began to do research into the underground organizations behind the graffiti, the
          relationship between different levels of discourse, such as top-down propaganda vs grass-roots art, and how
          space can interact with different forms of information.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I designed my own graffiti tag, called Eyesight, which I painted and pasted
          around
          the city. When I am not
          in Beijing, it helps me watch my home, eagerly looking at passers-by and conveying messages to them. Maybe in
          the future, more people will notice these traces and pay more attention to the city and its power dynamics and
          learn to find interesting views in the street.<br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have the right to choose entertainment, but I have noticed that television and
          social media have
          influenced people around me to perceive the world through short videos and articles that summarize the latest
          news, which has made them lose the patience to read serious articles or books.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, I created a dystopian brand, Nirvana, to sell objects that can be
          burned to quickly offer
          thoughtless happiness. I shaped the candles like objects that represent human mindfulness that are used to
          learn, record, think, and reflect in order to highlight a contrast with the urgent emotions and trend of rapid
          destruction symbolized by burning them.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used exaggerated promotional language so that people would want to use these items
          quickly without having to
          think deeply. If these five objects are burned, instead of being used for their thoughtful purposes, it means
          that we are happy to become creatures who don't know why we laugh and don't reflect on ourselves anymore.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I found that I and the people around me had wasteful habits, I asked myself, “Why
          do we throw away things
          that haven't been used up yet?” In the search for answers, I identified five objects which my family members
          felt were no longer valuable that I wanted to keep. I made a memorial for them by writing a biography of each
          item’s short, sad life journey and hand-making coffins to place each item in. I felt deeply sorry for them
          when
          I looked at them lying alone in the coffins.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show how people’s perception of products’ value is easily manipulated by
          consumerism,
          I used three prices to
          quantify the value of each item: the price people paid for it when they saw a new thing to buy, the price
          people
          gave it when they didn’t need it anymore, and the new price it could be sold for when people viewed the
          memorial. I found we easily lose desire for our possessions because we are reluctant to spend time and energy
          on
          maintaining old things when we are attracted by new products.

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drew a pamphlet of scenes recording my memories of times I spent with my friends.
          For
          example, I drew the
          memories of riding the highest roller coaster at the Halloween Haunt with my classmates last year, chatting
          with
          my friends about our hometowns on the way there, and making new friends while listening to music.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to give the pamphlet a lively feeling, I chose Riso printing, which is a
          method
          of stencil printing
          that allowed me to use pure, bright fluorescent colors. Since the computer couldn’t accurately display what
          the
          Riso ink was going to look like once it was printed, I used the color card as a reference to visualize the
          effect I wanted. Also, when using Riso printing, the alignment of the board is slightly different every time,
          so
          every page printed is a unique and beautiful accident, just like my favorite memories. Once it was printed and
          bound, I sent copies of the pamphlet to my friends so they can share the memories.

          opened the cabinet, there
          was a smell of a cedar forest. It seemed that there was a deep darkness calling me to travel to a new space. I
          believe that this is a door to a different parallel universe containing various natural spaces. I decided to
          share its mysterious calling with more people.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you open the biggest door of the cabinet, you are led to a deadly space full of
          poisonous thorns. I used
          two contrasting colors and a sharp composition to create this atmosphere. Then, when you open the first drawer
          on the left, you travel to a quiet lake. Be very careful when you open the drawer to the right because it's a
          cave full of bats. Finally, when you open the bottom drawer, you end the adventure and enter a sparkling ocean

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homemade braised fish is one of my favorite dishes. One day, when I looked at the dark
          sauce and fish on my
          plate, I wondered how it was made. I discovered that the ingredients for this dish are Texture, Shape, Space,
          and Color. Because of the complexity of Chinese cooking techniques, there is a big difference between the
          ingredients and the final appearance of a dish.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Texture: I cut the first ingredients from various angles and closely observed their
          texture.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shape: I placed the ingredients on a white background to study their positive and
          negative shapes.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space: I assembled the pieces of ingredients throughout a space to make them look like
          they are performing a
          story.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color: I used abstract shapes to express the color combinations of these natural
          ingredients.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of looking at the dish from a chef or food critic’s perspective, I used an
          image
          study to create a new
          recipe examining the ingredients in a new order and from a new perspective.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To set up the scene, I found two kinds of cloth: one is a very soft interlining
              cloth, and the other is a
              flat, white canvas. I folded the soft interlining into many subtle folds and laid it under the canvas.
              When I look out the window of an airplane, huge mountains and valleys look like small folds. When I
              depicted the folds in the cloth, I visualized them as gullies and mountains. The negative space of the
              white canvas, set off by the dark interlining, seems to form a doorway. It is a canvas painted on a
              canvas, so it seems likely to connect to a parallel universe.

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my daily sketching practice, I find it interesting to portray different materials
            in a scene. To develop this interest further and experiment with different ways to express warmth, material,
            shape, and space, I chose a scene of all white objects. I carefully observed details, saw subtle
            differences, and let these differences and similarities build a relationship.

          <h2 class="title-s">Five Snapshots of A Guitar</h2>
          <img src="./images/work/detail/image-10.jpg" class="work_img" style="width: 100%;"></img>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy looking at the curves of guitars, the connection between each component
            part, and the contrast of different materials, such as wood and metal. In this painting, I depict five
            detailed snapshots of a guitar. Together, these close views of the guitar deconstruct it, and the positive
            and negative relations in the five pictures recombine the space of the guitar. Zooming in on each section
            forces the viewer to look at the details of the guitar carefully, offering them puzzle pieces that can be
            used to reconstruct it.
